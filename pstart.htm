        Menstruation is a part of puberty. It's normal, healthy and a positive part of growing up!
        If you are experiencing any of the following 
        changes, chances are your first period is probably going to come soon!
        <ul>
        <li>Your breasts start to grow</li>
        <li>You become taller</li>
        <li>Your face/hair/body may become oilier</li>
        <li>You begin to grow underarm, legs and pubic hair</li>
        <li>Your body starts to develop its own odour</li>
        <li>You start to notice some whitish fluid traces in your panties</li>
        <li>You'll experience new emotions and feelings</li>

        But at what age do girls get their periods? What is the 'right time'?
        <ul>
        <li>Most girls get their first period when they're around 12. 
        But getting it any time between age 10 and 15 is OK. Every girl's body has its own schedule.
        </li>
        <li>It is important to remember that everyoneâ€™s bodies are different. 
            If you do not get your first period by the age of 16, it is advised to consult a physician.
        </li>
    </ul>
