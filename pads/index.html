<h1><center><b><u>SANITARY PADS</u></b></center></h1>
<br>
If you are new to the world of menstruation, pads are strongly recommended. 
They are comfortable as they come in a variety of sizes along with wings on the side to secure them.
They are attached to the inside of the user’s underwear, and work by absorbing menstrual blood through
 layers of absorbent material – usually rayon, cotton and plastic. Over the decades the design of pads
  has evolved to become much more absorbent and comfortable, with a wide range available to suit 
  different flows. 

<br> <br>
<big><b>How to Use Pads</b></big><br>
Pads or sanitary napkins come in different shapes and sizes — they can be thin for when you’re not 
bleeding a lot (pantyliners), regular, or thick for heavier bleeding (“maxi” or “super” pads). You 
can use whichever kind feels most comfortable to you.
<ul>
<li>Stick the pad in your underwear using the sticky strip on the back.Dispose the release paper.
 Some reusable pads are held in place with snaps or the elastic in your underwear.</li>

<li>Change your pad every few hours, or when it's soaked with blood.</li>

<li>Wrap used pads in the wrapper or toilet paper and throw them in the trash. Flushing used pads or 
wrappers down the toilet will clog it up and must not be done. </li>
</ul><br>

<big><b>Pros </b></big>
<ul>
    <li>
        Pads carry almost no risk of TSS.
    </li>
    <li>
        You don't need to insert anything.
    </li>
    <li>
        They come in lots of options to accommodate changes in your flow and activities.
    </li>
</ul>
<big><b>Cons</b></big>
 <br>
<ul>
<li>Frequent changes: You should change your pad every 3 to 4 hours, 
    no matter how heavy or light your flow is. Changing your pads this often
     helps keep certain odors away and, of course, helps lower the risk of bacteria buildup. </li>
    <li>They're not great for the environment. The environmental impact here is unavoidable, 
    unfortch. But some reusable options do exist, and some pads are using less plastic film these days
