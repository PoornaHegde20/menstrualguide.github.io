<h1><center><b>MENSTRUAL CUPS</b></center></h1>
Menstrual cups are flexible cups made of silicone or rubber that you wear inside your 
vagina to catch menstrual blood. Most are reusable, but some products, like menstrual
 discs, are disposable. <br>
Being reusable means you save a lot of money. It also means less landfill waste and fewer 
trees being cut down to make paper-based options and packaging.
<br>
<big><b>How to Use a Menstrual Cup</b></big>
<br>
Just follow these steps to use a cup:

<ol>
    <li>Wash your hands thoroughly.</li>
<li>Apply water or a water-based lube to the rim of the cup.</li>
<li>Tightly fold the menstrual cup in half, holding it in one hand with the rim facing up.</li>
<li>Insert the cup, rim up, into your vagina like you would a tampon without an applicator. It 
should sit a few inches below your cervix.</li>
<li>Once the cup is in your vagina, rotate it. It will spring open to create an airtight seal 
that stops leaks.</li></ol>

    </p>
You shouldn’t feel your menstrual cup if you’ve inserted the cup correctly. You should also 
be able to move, jump, sit, stand, and do other everyday activities without your cup falling
 out. If you’re having trouble putting in your cup, speak with your doctor.
<br>
<big><b>Pros</b></big>
<ul>
<li>Long-lasting: You can wear a menstrual cup for up to a jaw-dropping 12 hours at a time. 
(But, as with any period product, wearing it too long increases the risk of TSS.)</li>
<li>
Good for heavy flows: Like tamps, menstrual cups are better for heavier flow days (even 
though you can use them on lighter days). </li>
<li>They also come in different sizes for different 
flows and vaginal shapes.</li>
</ul>

<big><b>Cons</b></big> <br>
<ul>
<li>Messy: Since you have to use your fingers to find the cup and pull it out, you can expect 
a bit of a mess when it’s time to dump the cup.</li>
<li>Not fibroid-friendly: If you have fibroids, it may be tricky to find the cup once it’s inside you.
</li>
</ul>
