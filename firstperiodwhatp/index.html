        <br> <br>
        A period happens because of changes in hormones in the body. Hormones are chemical messengers. The ovaries release the female hormones estrogen and progesterone .
        These hormones cause the lining of the uterus (or womb) to build up. The built-up lining is ready for a fertilized egg to attach to and start developing.
        If there is no fertilized egg, the lining breaks down and bleeds. Then the same process happens all over again.
        <br>
        It usually takes about a month for the lining to build up, then break down. That is why most girls and women get their periods around once a month.
