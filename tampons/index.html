<h1><center><b><u>TAMPONS</u></b></center></h1>
Tampons act as a plug against menstrual blood, absorbing it from its place inside the vagina.
 These usually come with an applicator for quick insertion and a string for easy removal.
 <br> 
 <big><b>How to Use Tampons</b></big>
 <ol>
<li> Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and then unwrap the tampon. </li>
    <li>The applicator tip should be rounded and strings should hang out the bottom of the applicator. If you notice any flaws, do not use.</li>
<li>Gently pull on strings to make sure they are firmly attached.</li>
<li>
Get comfortable. Try sitting on the toilet with knees apart or standing with one foot on the toilet seat.</li>
<li>Gently insert the tampon applicator into your vagina: hold the applicator plunger using your thumb and middle finger. Place the applicator tip into your vagina at a 45˚ angle. Now, gently slide the smooth, tapered applicator all the way into your vagina until your fingers touch your body.</li>
<li>Push the tampon inside: push the plunger all the way into the barrel with your pointer finger. This will release the tampon. The plunger should now be inside the barrel. Still holding the plunger, gently pull out the tampon applicator. The tampon should now be inserted comfortably inside you in its precise place with the strings outside your body.
</li>
<li>After you have inserted the tampon, place the used applicator back into the discreet wrapper and throw away. DO NOT FLUSH THE PLASTIC APPLICATOR.</li>
<li>If there's any discomfort, the tampon may not be far enough inside. If this happens, just remove the tampon and try again with a new one. You won't feel anything when the tampon is correctly in place.</li>
<li>Tampon Removal: relax your muscles. Try getting into the position you used during insertion. Gently pull down on the strings. The tampon should slide out easily. Do not flush the used tampon in the toilet. Wrap the tampon in toilet paper and place it in an appropriate waste container.</li>
<li>Wash Hands:Remember to always wash your hands after removing or inserting tampons.</li></ol>

<big><b>Pros</b></big>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>A lot of women choose tampons because they’re small. </li>
    <li>They are rarely felt inside the body.</li>
<li>They allow for a greater range of activity — even swimming or playing sports.</li>
</ul>
<big><b>Cons</b></big> <br>
<ul>
<li>It is important to change tampons every 4-8 hours (overnight is okay) to avoid a build up 
of bacteria. </li>
<li>Tampons left in longer than 8 hours increases your risk of a very rare condition 
called Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) if worn for longer than 8 hours.
</li>
</ul>
